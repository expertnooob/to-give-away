# **ToGiveAway**

ToGiveAway is a Django-based web application that allows users to give away unused items for free to others. The platform is designed to promote sustainability by encouraging people to share items they no longer need rather than discarding them.

At first, it is specifically developed for students who come to the Capital of Nepal(Kathmandu) from rural parts of the country for education, work, or other opportunities. It could be immensely helpful for them to access items like:

Beds
Tables and chairs
Stoves
Blankets
Kitchenware
Other essential items
However, this technology could be useful for everyone who needs it, including individuals, families, and communities looking for essential items or aiming to reduce waste and share resources.
This system is created to create a positive impact by reducing waste, supporting students, and encouraging a culture of giving and sharing.

## **Features**

1. **User Authentication**  
   - Register, log in, and manage user profiles.

2. **Item Listings**  
   - Users can post items they want to give away, including:  
   - Items can be marked as "Claimed" once taken.

3. **Search & Filters**

4. **Messaging**  
   - Users can contact the owner of an item via a built-in messaging system.

5. **Admin Panel**
